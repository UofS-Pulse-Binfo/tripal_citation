# Tripal Citation

Tripal Fields specific to providing automated citations for data based on properties + publications

## Core Purpose

Make a field available for most Tripal Content Types to provide an easily copy/pastable citation for data. This citation should link directly to the actual publlication, if available, and not to the Tripal Publication content type. If there is no publication, this field should use an admin entered template and chado property records associated either 1) with the data directly or 2) associated with a chado project or chado analysis that the data belong to. The template used is specific to the type of data.
